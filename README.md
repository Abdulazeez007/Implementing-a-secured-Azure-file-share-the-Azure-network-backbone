# Implementing-a-secured-Azure-file-share-on-the-Azure-network-backbone
In this lab, I will deploy an Azure Storage Account and configure a secure Azure File Share. This file share will be inaccessible from the internet, as I will implement security measures over the Azure Backbone Network, allowing secure access through a dedicated private subnet that hosts a secure virtual machine (VM).

Additionally, I will set up a public subnet with another VM to verify that my file share remains inaccessible from the public internet.
